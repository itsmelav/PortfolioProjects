Process of Workflow:

•	To connect and transform the raw data from those CSV files,
•	Use those tables to build a relational data model to blend information together,
•	Create new calculated columns and DAX measures using Power Query.
•	And finally, design an interactive report to actually analyse and visualize all of this data.

Approach:

=> [GET DATA INTO POWER BI] Loading the .csv Input files into power BI. The input files comprised of 6 .CSV files namely,
